# Weather App Made With ES8 JS Syntax

This is a very simple app that I built to start learning Node.js and Javascript in general. Its main purpose is to display the current weather conditions in a city that the user enters. S/he can also select the unit to display the temperature in (Fahrenheit or Celcius). It also displays some additional information.

I didn't use **view engines** or **templating engines** because:
1. This is a small app
2. I am not yet comfortable with templating engines.

*However, my next projects will surely make use of a templating engine.*

My choice of API is also questionable, but as I said, I just got started with this.
